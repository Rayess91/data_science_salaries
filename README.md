Project Title: Data Science Salaries / Focus on Europe

Purpose and Motivation:

Understanding salary trends in the data science field can provide insights for career planning and job markets. As we finish our data analytics bootcamp, gaining an understanding of salary analysis will be beneficial in several ways:

Career Planning: Setting realistic expectations and goals for our career paths in data science.

Informed Decisions: Making informed decisions regarding job opportunities, salary negotiations, and career progression.

What?

The project focuses on analyzing data science salaries across Europe. The data sources are derived from four datasets taken from kaggle.com and webscraped from ai-jobs.net.

These datasets contain information about data science salaries and companies from all over the world. I have combined them and extracted the information for companies based in Europe.

Additionally, I have webscraped cost of living data from numebo.com to examine the relationship between salaries and the cost of living in European countries.

The goals of the project include:

Analyzing and visualizing salary trends in the data science field focusing on the European market.

Identifying average salaries for different experience levels and employment types.

Examining the impact of company size and location on salaries.

Investigating the relationship between salaries and the cost of living in European countries.
